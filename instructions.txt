Question 2: Networked Machine Detector
N.B:File must be run on an Ubuntu operating system because of the location of libcap package, other distros
threw errors as libcap was stored at different directories.

Python 2.7.6 is needed
python-pip recommended for installing libraries
N.B a shell script was added that also installs all neccessary libraries and programs and moves p0f to appropriate folder i.e 
performs Steps 1-8 for you if you rather use that.

Instructions:
Step 1: Download ipaddr library https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipaddr or python -m pip install ipaddr in command line
Step 2: Download p0f wget http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/releases/p0f-latest.tgz
Step 3: extract p0f to current directory tar xzf p0f-latest.tgz
Step 4: Change directory into extracted folder cd p0f-3.09b
Step 5: Install essential tools if not already installed sudo apt-get install build-essential libpcap-dev
Step 6: Complile p0f using the following commands: make
                                                   cd tools
                                                   make
                                                   cd ..
Step 7: Move files to appropriate directories: cp p0f /usr/local/bin/
                                               cp p0f.fp /etc/
                                               cp tools/p0f-client /usr/local/bin/
Step 8: Download p0f API library https://pypi.python.org/pypi/p0f/1.0.0 or python -m pip install ipaddr in command line
Step 9: Run nettest.py with root privaledges.
